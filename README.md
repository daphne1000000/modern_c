Hi! In October 2024 I finished NYU's Tandon Bridge course and my favorite section was the section on Operating Systems.

I want to dive deeper into systems programming and step 1 of that is really mastering C. The course was taught in C++ so it shouldn't be
*too* hard, but the two languages are different enough that I think it bears some specialized studying. Additionally, I feel there are some things
(e.g. pointers, threads, etc.) that were only briefly covered that I want to get more down and dirty with, so this book feels like a great way to do just that.

Being a lover of the classics in general, I would normally go for K&R, however I think in this case studying a more modern version of C would be more helpful for my career moving forward. Who knows.

This book includes many exercises that should be relatively easy, and then many challenges which are... challenging.

These might take a few hours or even a few days, so I guess I should remain persistent :)
