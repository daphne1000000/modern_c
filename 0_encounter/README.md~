The first thing that's different from C++ is the existence of format specifiers, which specify where in the output to palce numbers.
These are marked with the percent (%) character.

To compile I need to use the following command:

clang -std=c2x -Wall -lm -o getting-started getting-started.c

*EXPLANATION OF ALL OF THOSE FLAGS*

-std=c2x: tells the compiler to use the latest version of C (C23)
-Wall: enters the complete diagnostic mode
-lm: links to the c mathlibrary --> it looks like the linker that my machine uses is ld 
-o: specifies where to put the output
